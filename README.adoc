= MyAQ Infrastructure as Code

* Use eks-create-cluster.sh to create your EKS cluster
* Use deployment.yml to create your Kubernetes deployment

== CI/CD Environment

* MyAQ frontend and MyAQ backend uses GitHub for its SCM, Docker Hub for its image repository
and Kubernetes for Container Orchestration.

* Ideally there would be a CI/CD Pipeline Orchestration Tool such as Jenkins that will pull or listen to GitHub repository.
This will execute the build, include all necessary CI steps along the way such as unit test, quality scan, etc..

* Once Docker image is created, it can then be stored to Docker Hub or Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

* EKS cluster is created or prepared while image deployment will be done through Kubernetes Deployments
